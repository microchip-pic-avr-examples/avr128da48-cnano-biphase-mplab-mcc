 # Bi-phase Decoder

The Bi-phase Mark Code (BMC) combines both data and clock in a single signal. One clock cycle is a BMC bit period. A transition always occurs at the beginning of each bit period. A logic `1` is represented by a transition (rising or falling edge) in the middle of the bit period.
A logic `0` is represented by no transition in the middle of the period. A BMC encoder accepts a data signal and clock signal as inputs and produces a single BMC-encoded output. A BMC decoder accepts a BMC-encoded signal as the input and produces two outputs: data and clock.
BMC is used in standards such as the USB 3.1 Power Delivery Specification CC signaling, AES3 digital audio, or S/PDIF audio.

An example is presented in the figure below:

This project is an implementation of a Bi-phase Decoder using CIP (Core Independent Peripherals) by following the interaction between TCA, TCB, Event System, CCL and SPI peripherals. The encoded data is received through a single data wire. The NRZ (Non-return-to-zero) signal and clock signal are recovered using the circuit composed of the CIP mentioned above. The resulting signals are routed to the SPI peripheral which reads the data. The decoded data is transmitted further via serial communication. 

The bi-phase encoded signal is received through a single wire. A decoding circuit is implemented using the combination between CCL, Event System and timers. The decoding circuit outputs the recovered NRZ data and a synchronized clock signal that are routed with jumper wires to the SPI peripheral configured in client mode. The SPI peripheral will generate interrupts whenever a new byte is received, and the current byte will be stored in a buffer. The data is further transmitted via serial communication (USART1). A time-out mechanism is implemented using TCA0 (an interrupt will be generated when no activity occurs on the bi-phase data line for the duration of 6 bytes). A FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer mechanism is implemented in order to facilitate the data storage and minimze data loss.

The block diagram of this application is presented in the figure below:
