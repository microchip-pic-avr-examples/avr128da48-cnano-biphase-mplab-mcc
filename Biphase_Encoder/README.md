 # Bi-phase Encoder

The Bi-phase Mark Code (BMC) combines both data and clock in a single signal. One clock cycle is a BMC bit period. A transition always occurs at the beginning of each bit period. A logic `1` is represented by a transition (rising or falling edge) in the middle of the bit period.
A logic `0` is represented by no transition in the middle of the period. A BMC encoder accepts a data signal and clock signal as inputs and produces a single BMC-encoded output. A BMC decoder accepts a BMC-encoded signal as the input and produces two outputs: data and clock.
BMC is used in standards such as the USB 3.1 Power Delivery Specification CC signaling, AES3 digital audio, or S/PDIF audio.

An example is presented in the figure below:

This project is an implementation of a Bi-phase Encoder using CIPs by following the interaction between USART, Event System, SPI and CCL peripherals. The raw data is received via serial communication, encoded using the circuit composed of the CIP mentioned above and sent further through a single data wire. 

The raw data is received via serial communication by the USART1 peripheral. This data is then stored in a buffer and used as input for the SPI0 peripheral which generates NRZ (Non-return-to-zero) data signal and a clock signal. Those signals are selected as inputs for the circuit composed of CCL (Configurable Custom Logic) and Event System which outputs the Bi-phase encoded signal. A FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer mechanism is implemented to facilitate the data storage and minimze data loss.

The block diagram of this application is presented in the figure below:
